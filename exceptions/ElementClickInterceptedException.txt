ElementClickInterceptedException is an exception that occurs when we are trying
to perform click operation on a web element but action is intercepted by another
element. This often means that the intended element is not currently
interactable because it is covered by another element on the page, such as
pop-up, overlapping elements, etc.

ElementClickInterceptedException can occurs in the following scenarios:
1.Overlapping elements
There may be overlapping elements on the web page like pop-up's or window modal
displayed on the element you want to click. Overlapping elements can cause
different exceptions but it will throw an ElementClickInterceptedException if we
try to click the element.

2.Displayed elements
Another reason for getting ElementClickInterceptedException is that the element
might be disabled when trying to perform click operation.

3.Synchronization issues
There may be synchronization issues while dealing with web applications.
For example, when trying to click login button for a login page, web page load
time should be considered before clicking on the login button.

4.Dynamic Content Loading
These days, most websites dynamically load their web pages using AJAX or 
Javascript. In this case, it becomes difficult to locate elements, so it's
better to wait for an element visibility and then perform the required action.

How to handle ElementClickInterceptedException in Selenium?
1.Check for Overlapping elements
2.Use Explicit Waits
3.Scroll to the element
4.Increase the wait times between elements
