StaleElementReferenceException is one of the most common Selenium exceptions
which is often surfaced when the web element you are trying to interact with
is no longer associated with an HTML element in the DOM. As Selenium tries to
reference a stale element, it throws a StaleElementReferenceException. It is 
one of the WebDriverException class in Selenium.

The possible reasons for the web element getting stale can be:
- a page refresh;
- DOM update;
- location of the web element being changed.

When does Stale Element Reference Exception occur?
1. The HTML web element is No Longer present on the webpage:
There can be scenarios when the web page gets refreshed or updated to a
JavaScript operation and hence the reference of the elements to be interacted
with gets stale leading to StaleElementReferenceException.
2. Permanent deletion of the ReferencedElement:
There can be scenarios where the referenced element might have been permanently
deleted. For instance, if the web page where the element resides has been
refreshed before the interaction with the element actually took place.
