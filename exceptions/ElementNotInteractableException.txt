ElementNotInteractableExceptions is thrown by Selenium WebDriver whe the element
is present in the DOM but cannot be interacte with. This includes an element
that is not displayed or whose center point cannot be scrolled into the
viewport. The element is not interactable in the sense it cannot be clicked or
send keys cannot work as element is:
- not visible or hidden;
- disabled;
- outside the viewport and inaccessible;
- overlapped by another element;
- not completely rendered on the page.

When does an ElementNotInteractableExceptions occur?
1. Element is not visible: If the targeted web element present in the DOM is
hidden or covered by another element it makes it non-interactive.
2. Element is disabled: If the web element is present in the DOM but is
disabled, such as disabled button or disabled checkbox or radio button. This
element cannot be interacted with until it is enabled.
3. Element is outside the viewport and inaccessible: When the element is present
in the DOM but is not in view, it can be made interactive only after the view
is scrolled.
4. Element is overlapped by another element: if the web element to be interacted
with is overlapped by another web element such as modal dialog, it cannot be
interacted with until the overlapping element is moved or removed.
5. Element is not rendered: if the web element is rendered dynamically on the
web page and is not fully loaded when the interaction takes place, it cannot be
interacted until it is loaded completely.
